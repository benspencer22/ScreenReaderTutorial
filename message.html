    <h1>Windows Narrator Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>We used the most updated version of Google Chrome, Windows, and Windows Reader.</h2>
    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>
        Looking at Windows Narrator, we can see that it is a free Windows screen reading app that allows people who may have a 
        condition preventing them from browsing the web to search/use the web as anyone else would.
        For this tutorial, we will be explaining the shortcut keys, good and bad websites to surf using this tool, and what distinguishes between these types of websites.
        We will be assuming that the user is using Windows 10 as an operating system, using google chrome as the browser, and using the most recent version of the software (Last updated March 29th, 2022).
        <br>
        <br>
        For a more in depth tutorial that will specify controls for other versions, see the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1"><b>Microsoft Help Page</b></a>.
    </p>
<h2>Basic Shortcut Keys:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In order to start windows narrator, the user must press: <b>Windows logo key + Ctrl + Enter</b>.</li>
    <li>If the original start shortcut is not working or if you are running a previous version of Windows, the user can try the shortcut: <b>Windows logo key + Enter</b> instead.</li>
    <li>To go to the next object on the page, the user may press: <b>Tab</b>.</li>
    <li>To go to the previous object on the page, the user may press: <b>Shift + Tab</b>.</li>
    <li>In order to turn off windows narrator, the user can press either: <b>Windows logo key + Ctrl + Enter</b> or press: <b>Caps Lock + Esc</b>.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>The Best Website: <a href="https://www.dominos.com/en"><b>Domino's</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        The website we found easiest to use was the Domino's website. Each tab labeled with a clear name for easy navigation when blindfolded.
        When creating a pizza it goes through each topping individually before highlighting next to make sure the user won't miss one.
        Once the user is ready to pay it goes through the options for delivery and carryout and then goes through payment options. It also read
        back what was in your cart to make sure you ordered correctly. There is also an option at the end to edit individual items to prevent having 
        to remake the entire order.
    </p>
    <h2>The Worst Website: <a href="https://www.barstoolsports.com/"><b>Barstool Sport's</b></a></h2>
    <p>
        The website we found hardest to use was Barstool Sport's. This was maily for a couple main reasons. The first is that on the first screen 
        there is moving text, making it hard to navigate. Everytime it cycled it could only read the cycle apparent on the screen at the time. 
        This made it hard to know if you were moving to the next item or if the screen was just moving.
       When attempting to using tab, it would seem to jump around randomly without order. Secondly, there are a lot of menu options at the top of every page and because of 
        that we had to tab close to 10 times just to get to the options on the page we selected. This made it hard to navigate from section to section.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>With technology becoming more adaptive, web developers need to stay on top of their game to allow all possible users, despite any possible disabilities, to comfortably 
        access their website.</p>
